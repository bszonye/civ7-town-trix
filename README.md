# City Hall 1.2.0
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production chooser
reorganizes the production list to improve readability and to show more
items.  building yields now appear directly next to the *ageless* icon.

## better population visibility
adds color to the city & town interface:

- green hexes for rural improvements
- blue hexes for urban districts
- a purple hex for the city center

## unique quarter helper
guides unique quarter construction in the building interface.  orange
hexes indicate any tile placement that would block a unique quarter,
including:

- placing unique buildings on different tiles
- completing a non-unique quarter with a unique building
- adding a non-unique building to a unique district

the interface now recognizes unique buildings in progress and in the
production queue, to help you plan both buildings at the same time.

## bug fixes
adjacency arrows now appear every time you place a building.  previously
they would only appear the very first time.

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **MantisMaestro's Compact Production Chooser: compatible.**  MM's mod
  has higher priority and will override the City Hall production list.
- **KayleeR's Misc UI Modifications: compatible.**  City Hall has higher
  priority and will override KayleeR's unique quarter features.
