# City Hall
better city & town tools for Civilization VII

## improved production chooser
reorganized the production list to improve readability and to show more
items.  building yields now appear directly next to the *ageless* icon.

## better population visibility
added color to the city & town interface:

- green hexes for rural improvements
- blue hexes for urban districts
- a purple hex for the city center

## unique building guides
highlighted unique districts in the building placement lens.  all
districts with unique building appear in Culture purple, to help you
find them again when placing the second building (and to help you avoid
placing non-unique buildings there by mistake).
